# Sample Rate
Here you will learn how to see the sampling frequency of an audio.

## What is sample rate?
Basically, it’s the frequency that our audio can reach, which is measured in KHz. If you choose an incorrect sample rate to train a type of sound unrelated to the voice, it can result in a poor model.

- To do this, we need the program [Spek](https://www.spek.cc/p/download). If you have Applio installed on your PC, you can check the [audio analyzer](/get-started\audio-analyzer.md/) section.

- Drag your dataset into the program and you’ll get a graph like this.

- Now that you’ve seen that your audio has an audio frequency of 17500KHz, we multiply it by two and we would have our sampling frequency.

!!!info Info
In case you get a frequency like 35k, you should choose the one that is closest to that frequency.
