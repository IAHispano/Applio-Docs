# How to infer

- When we have the model ready we will go back to the 'inference' section, upload the audio using the corresponding checkbox and wait for the message to change from "uploading..." to "download", with this we can hit the 'refresh' button and select the pth audio and index of our model to finally start with the audio conversion.

- in case the model you are downloading has in the title extraction methods like **crepe, harvest or mangio-crepe** check the *'advanced options'* box and change the extraction method to the corresponding one, applio by default uses rvmpe, changing it to the corresponding method helps to always have the best conversion quality.
