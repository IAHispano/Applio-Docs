# How to infer

- When we have the model ready we will go back to the 'Model inference' section.

1. **upload your audio**, make sure it is only vocals 
2. click the **'refresh'** button at the top right and select the downloaded/uploaded files in the **_Inferencing voice_** and **_index path_** box.
3. press **convert** and in a few seconds you will have your inference done!


- **recommendation:** having a 'clean acapella' helps to get better results. but if the model downloaded in its name mentions the words **rvmpe, crepe or mangio-crepe** click on the **advanced options box** and select the right method, this will help to have more acurrate pitch control
