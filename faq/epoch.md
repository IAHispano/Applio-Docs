# Epoch
An Epoch is the number of iterations performed during training to complete one full cycle of your dataset. For example, if you have a dataset of 200 audio samples and you set a batch_size of 10, 10 audio samples will be processed in each iteration. To process all 200 audio samples, you will need to perform 20 iterations in total. This complete cycle is referred to as one epoch.
