# Python "module" not found

## I'm getting the error python "module" not found or similar

First try to open the applio manager and selecting the third option if that doesnt works go to the requirements .txt and search for the module that is causing the error and in the cmd use this commands

(Change module with the name of the module that you searched in the requirements)

```bash
pip uninstall module
```

```bash
pip install module
```
