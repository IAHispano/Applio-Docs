# Dependencies
In this section you will found the why the dependencies are required or not for the conda installer to function.

## Visual Studio Build Tools

Visual Studio Build Tools **are required** for the installer to function. Because of that they are **semi automatically** downloaded and installed in the installer.

## Visual C++ Redistributable

Visual C++ Redistributable is **no required** for the installer to function. Becuase the conda env used by the installer already has the redistributable installed.

## Git

Git is **not required** for the installer to function. The installer automatically downloads Mingit, eliminating the need for Git to be pre-installed.

## Python

Python is **not required** for the installer to function. The installer utilizes Conda, so there's no need to have Python installed beforehand.
