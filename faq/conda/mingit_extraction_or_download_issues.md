# Issues with Mingit Extraction or Download

If there are problems extracting Mingit or download errors preventing progress, manually download the [Mingit ZIP file](https://huggingface.co/IAHispano/applio/resolve/main/mingit.zip). Make sure to delete the Appio folder if any issues arise.

## Alternative for Persistent Mingit Issues

If Mingit problems persist, manually [install Git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.42.0.windows.2/Git-2.42.0.2-64-bit.exe). This may be necessary if the repository copy isn't successful.
