# Issues with Mingit Extraction or Download

If there are problems extracting Mingit or download errors preventing progress, manually download the Mingit ZIP file. Make sure to delete the Appio folder if any issues arise.

## Alternative for Persistent Mingit Issues

If Mingit problems persist, manually install Git. This may be necessary if the repository copy isn't successful.
