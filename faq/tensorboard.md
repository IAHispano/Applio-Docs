# Tensorboard

Tensorboard is a series of graphs where we can monitor the progress of our model during training, but there are many graphs. We are only interested in the graph called 'g/total'. You can find this by clicking on 'inactive' and selecting 'scalars'. Then, go to the last page, where you will find it in the last graph.
