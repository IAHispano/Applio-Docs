<div class="codeblock-wrapper"><doc-codeblock line-numbers>
<pre class="language-none"><code v-pre class="language-none">1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
   the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
   non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
   exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

     a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
        in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and

     b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
        NonCommercial purposes only.

2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
   Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
   License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
   its terms and conditions.

3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
   6(a).

4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
   Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
   all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
   and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
   Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
   authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
   necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
   technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
   Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
   simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
   (4) never produces Adapted Material.

5. Downstream recipients.

     a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
        recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
        receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
        Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
        Public License.

     b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
        any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
        apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
        Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
        Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
        Material.

6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
   may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
   are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
   with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
   the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
   provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).</code></pre>

   extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
   Rights, but not otherwise.

2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this

<p>Using Creative Commons Public Licenses</p>
<p>Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.</p>
<div class="codeblock-wrapper"><doc-codeblock line-numbers>
<pre class="language-none"><code v-pre class="language-none"> Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
 intended for use by those authorized to give the public
 permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
 copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
 irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
 and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
 Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
 applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
 material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
 material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
 licensed material, or material used under an exception or
 limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

 Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
 licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
 licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
 the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
 example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
 copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
 licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
 other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
 the licensed material may still be restricted for other
 reasons, including because others have copyright or other
 rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
 such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
 Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
 respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations

License.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the

<li><p>NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards
commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of
this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for
other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital
file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is
no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the
exchange.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such

<ol type="a">
<li><p>License grant.</p>
<div class="codeblock-wrapper"><doc-codeblock line-numbers>
<pre class="language-none"><code v-pre class="language-none">1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
   the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
   non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
   exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

     a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
        in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and

     b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
        NonCommercial purposes only.

2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
   Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
   License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
   its terms and conditions.

3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
   6(a).

4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
   Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
   all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
   and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
   Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
   authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
   necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
   technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
   Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
   simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
   (4) never produces Adapted Material.

5. Downstream recipients.

     a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
        recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
        receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
        Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
        Public License.

     b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
        any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
        apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
        Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
        Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
        Material.

6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
   may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
   are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
   with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
   the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
   provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).</code></pre>

   the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
   assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
   extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
   Rights, but not otherwise.

2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
   Public License.

3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
   collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
   Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
   under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
