# Other Alternatives
Thanks to our team, we were able to bring Applio to other places for your convenience

+++ Cloud
 1. Enter [Applio Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/iahispano/applio/blob/master/assets/Applio.ipynb) and just **run the 2 cells**. 
 ![](../assets/Colab.png)

 2. Then a **public link** will be given to us where we can enter the interface.

 !!!info Info
 You should select the Drive icon, which generates a code that allows you to mount your Drive in Colab. Keep in mind that this will clone the entire repository to your drive.

 3. You can [train](/get-started\training.md/) models, do [inference](/get-started\inferencing.md/), or use [TTS](/get-started\tts.md/)

 4. Your trained model is located in the logs/model folder, and the .pth files are in the logs/zips folder. If you want to save your model folder, you just need to move that folder and your modelâ€™s .pth file to your drive.

 5. (If you want to retrain move that folder to Colab again, enter the same name of the model and locate in which stage the save files are left, enter a higher number of epochs.)
+++ Hugginface
 1. First you need to create a hugginface account.

 2. Then enter [Applio Hugginface Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/IAHispano/Applio) and duplicate the space, that is all. If you don't want to use huggingface you can use  [Applo playground](https://applio.org/playground).
