# Other Alternatives
Thanks to our team, we were able to bring Applio to other places for your convenience

==- Applio Colab
 1. Enter [Applio Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/iahispano/applio/blob/master/assets/Applio.ipynb) and just **run the 2 cells**.

 2. Then a **public link** will be given to us where we can enter the interface.

 !!!info Info
 You can select the **Drive icon**, which will generate a code for you to mount your Drive in Colab

 !!!

 3. You can [train](/get-started\training.md/) models, do [inference](/get-started\inferencing.md/), or use [TTS](/get-started\tts.md/)

==- Hugginface Space
 1. First you need to create a hugginface account.

 2. Then enter [Applio Hugginface Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/IAHispano/Applio) and duplicate the space, that is all. If you don't want to use huggingface you can use  [Applo playground](https://applio.org/playground).
