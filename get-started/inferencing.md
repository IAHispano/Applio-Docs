# How to infer

- When we have the model ready we will go back to the **'inference'** section.

1. **upload your audio and select it**, make sure it is only vocals
2. click the **'refresh'** button at the top right and select the downloaded/uploaded files in the **_Voice model_** and **_index file_** box.
3. press **convert** and you will have your inference done!

- **recommendation:** having a **'clean acapella'** helps to get better results. but if the model downloaded in its name mentions the words **rvmpe, crepe or mangio-crepe** click on the **advanced options box** and select the right method, this will help to have more acurrate pitch control.

!!!info
You can adjust your inference by clicking on the **Advanced Settings** option.
