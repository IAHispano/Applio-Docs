# Installation

Installing [Applio](https://docs.applio.org/beginners/frequent-doubts/#what-is-applio-and-where-can-i-use-it) is a simple process, just download the .bat file of the latest version **[via the official repository](https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/releases)**, extract the zip file and run the `run-install.bat (Windows) or run-install-sh (Linux)`, wait for it to download the necessary content and run the `run-applio.bat or run-applio.sh` file.

!!!warning Before Installing:
- Make sure that you place Applio on C driver.
- Do not put it in a folder with privileged access.
- Do not run the run-install.bat as an administrator.
- Make sure the path does not contain any spaces.
- Desactivate your antivirus and firewall to avoid missing dependencies.
!!!

If you encounter an error during execution, you can try the [precompiled](/faq\Installation\Compiled.md) version of Applio.
